-- Part 2 of 2 (see V1235).  Now that V1235's backfill has committed and its
-- trigger events have fired, drop the deprecated c_is_splittable column and
-- recreate the two views that referenced it, recomputing c_is_splittable from
-- the new c_execution_requirement enum.  This is a separate migration purely so
-- that this ALTER runs in a transaction with no pending trigger events.
