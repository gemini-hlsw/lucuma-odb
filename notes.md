Hats give the big picture of who I am.

- I am a guest.
- I am a science user.
- I am an NGO representative.
- I am on staff.
- I am a system administrator.

With respect to a given science programs:

- I can be a collaborator (pi, coi, spectator).
- I can be in a staff support role.
- I can be in an NGO support role.
- I can be indirectly associated because my NGO granted time to the program.
- I can be unassociated.

The user interface can filter the programs I see.
- As a guest or science user I have no choices. I see programs all where I am a collaborator.
- As an NGO representative I can choose:
  ( ) All programs granted time by <partner>, or
  ( ) Just programs where I am responsible for NGO support (<partner>).
- As a staff or admin user I can choose:
  ( ) All programs, or
  ( ) Programs where I am responsible for staff support.
- Semester, program type, and status filters apply on top of this.
